# Python-XML-Decode
IN THIS PYTHON SCRIPT YOU CAN DECODE YOUR URL AND EMAIL ADDRESS AND SAVE IT IN XML FILE.
SCRIPTS LIKE THIS ARE USING FOR THE SECURITY OUR PRIVACY, LIKE USERNAME, EMAIL, PASSWORD AND ELSE..

I PUT THE URL AND EMAIL IN THIS SCRIPT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DECODE ALL INFO ABOUT OUR SITE AND USERS..
IF YOU WANT YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO DECODE NAME, USERNAME, PASSWORDS AND OTHERS..
